So, when I've done the previous task of encoding data to a QR i also faced the issue of QR can't store large data.

So I have searched for ways and then I find that we can use AWS, Dropbox , Google Drive and other cloud storage platforms.

I also thought of using youtube for video formats as this is the easiest place to upload videos, No restriction on storage , because every
other platform has some limitation for their storage. But we have to use this for all types of format.

So I came to choose Google Drive as my final stop.

I have used the Google Cloud Console and ith Google Drive API, integrated my qr code encoder to encode the 
"id" it returns for the files that we upload using this and stores the QR code in .png format.

My basic structure or working is like This

--> You make a service account on Google Cloud
    |--> Download it's key (.json file)
    |--> Set your file path to "SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE"

---> You have made a personal G-Drive for yourself

---> You upload your files of any type, and you receive a ID back from the cloud

---> You simply use your previous Encoder to encode that "ID" to make a QR code .png file

---> That QR is then can be shared, and Decoder is used to retrieve back the "ID"

---> For the same service account thi ID, can be used to download your files back from the Cloud.
