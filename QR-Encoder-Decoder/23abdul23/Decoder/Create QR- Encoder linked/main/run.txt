For 1.png:

```
    #Step 1: Upload the file to the Google Drive
    uploaded_id = upload_file("1.png", "Test_img.png")

    #Step 2: Generate the QR code
    qr_genrate(uploaded_id, "out_img.png")

    #Step 3: Decode the QR code (This step can be done from another system also but 
    # with the same QR code and the correct service_account_key)

    qr_decoder("out_img.png", "final_img.png")
```

For test.txt

```
    #Step 1: Upload the file to the Google Drive
    uploaded_id = upload_file("test.txt", "Test.txt")

    #Step 2: Generate the QR code
    qr_genrate(uploaded_id, "out_txt.png")

    #Step 3: Decode the QR code (This step can be done from another system also but 
    # with the same QR code and the correct service_account_key)

    qr_decoder("out_txt.png", "final_text.txt")
```
