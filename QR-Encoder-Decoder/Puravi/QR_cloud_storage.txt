To solve this issue of encoding large files in a QR, we can upload them to a cloud-based storage platform and these platforms may or may not require authentication. Some such platforms are categorized as follows:
Platforms That Require Authentication

These platforms require user accounts and access credentials (API keys, OAuth tokens, etc.) to upload files.

1. Google Drive 
   - Authentication: OAuth2 via `gdrive`, `rclone`, or Google Drive API.
   - URL Retrieval: File ID-based URLs.

2. AWS S3  
   - Authentication: AWS Access Key and Secret Key via AWS CLI or SDKs.
   - URL Retrieval: Public or pre-signed URLs.

3. Microsoft OneDrive 
   - Authentication: OAuth2 via Microsoft Graph API.
   - URL Retrieval: Shareable links via API.

4. iCloud (Only for Apple users)  
   - Authentication: Apple ID and app-specific password.
   - URL Retrieval: Shareable links via API or web interface.

Platforms That Do Not Require Authentication

These platforms allow uploads without requiring user accounts or credentials, often for temporary or public use.

1. Transfer.sh  
   - No authentication required.
   - Upload via `curl` or HTTP POST.
   - Returns a temporary shareable URL.

2. File.io 
   - No authentication required.
   - Files are deleted after a single download (configurable).
   - Shareable URL provided upon upload.

3. GoFile.io  
   - No authentication required for basic uploads.
   - Shareable URL provided upon upload.

A quick fix (jugaadu) solution to this is creating a public google drive folder where "anyone with the link can edit". Hence no individual authenication is needed for uploads but folder owner controls access.

To do this on linux, we can use rclone. The steps to do this are as follows:
1. Install rclone
  sudo apt install rclone
2. Configure it to google drive
  rclone config
    a. Type n to create a new remote.
    b. Enter a name for the remote (e.g., MyDrive).
    c. Choose drive as the storage type.
    d. Authenticate your Google account (via the browser link provided).
    e. Grant access to your Google Drive.
3. Create a new folder in Google Drive
  rclone mkdir MyDrive:folder_name
4. Upload files to the drive 
  rclone copy <file_path> mydrive:folder_name
  //replace <file_path> with the actual path of your file
5. Get the URL by
  rclone link MyDrive:folder_name
  //this command outputs a URL which we can encode
  //verify whether the folder is public from the URL
